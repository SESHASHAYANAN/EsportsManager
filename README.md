#AI Powered Esports Manager

The LLM-powered digital assistant, built using Ge Bedrock, is designed to help build teams and answer questions about VALORANT esports players. Leveraging fine-tuned machine learning models, the assistant retrieves and analyzes data from various sources to provide insights, player comparisons, and team recommendations. Its chat interface, built with React, offers a smooth user experience, while Tailwind CSS ensures a responsive and aesthetically pleasing design. The backend, powered by Node.js, facilitates data processing and communication between the assistant and Bedrock. Customization and fine-tuning of the LLM allow it to handle specific esports-related queries accurately, making it a powerful tool for scouting, recruitment, and strategy formulation in VALORANT and esports games.
